Bayesian Compressed Deep Learning for State Estimation in Electrical Energy Distribution Networks

This repository contains the code and data for reproducing the experiments in the paper 
"Bayesian Compressed Deep Learning for State Estimation in Electrical Energy Distribution Networks"

The code is composed of a Jupyter notebook ("Network_Test.ipynb"), along with auxiliary Python files and dataset.

Step 1: Download the zip file of the repository and unzip it in your local computer:
